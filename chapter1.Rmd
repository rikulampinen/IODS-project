# About the project

### The course:

The course *Introduction to open data science* started on Wednesday 30^th^ October 2019. 


### My feelings:
  
**I'm feeling so excited!!**

I got aware of the course by an announcement some weeks ago on the University of Eastern Finland's
yammer platform.
After hecking the course material on MOOC platform I see great new things coming up for me to learn. 
So I'm very excited about it.  
I'm looking forward to meet all the new things I will learn in this course and especially I'm looking forward to meet all challenges coming up in this course.  
I hope I can manage all assignments.  
  

**I'm expecting to learn a lot about data handling, improve my R skills and hopefully be able to use this knowledge later on in my work.**
