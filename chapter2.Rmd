# Chapter 2: Data wrangling and performing a regression analysis

*Work of week 45 (4.11. - 10.11.2019)*

#### 1. Data wrangling

* **4.11.2019**: Started to work through the DataCamp exercises offered by the IODS course and was able to finish  
    - R Short and Sweet   
    - R Helsinki Open Data Science courses      
    

* **5.11.2019**: Start to work on R script for Data wrangling and regression analysis  
    - Wrote the script for data wrangling and was able to finish that part    
      (all tests on the script worked)
  
#### 2. Analysis

The work on the analysis script and documentation started on 6.11.2019  

1. Read the dataset table from my data folder and checked the dataframe structure and dimensions 
When I read the data table I set the "stringsAsFactor" agument (in the read.table function) to FALSE. So the observations in the gender column stay "F" and "M".  
The dataframe includes 166 observations (the rows) in 7 variables (the columns).  

    The data we analyise consists of a survey from students relating their learning approaches.
The data includes the students' gender, age, exam points and the global attitude towards statistics (consisting of a sum of 10 questions related to students attitude towards statistics, each measured on the Likert scale (1-5). The attitude value was divided by 10 in the data wrangling part to show the value in the 1-5 scale.

- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods.
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using.
