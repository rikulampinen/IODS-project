# Chapter 2: Data wrangling and performing a regression analysis

#### *Work of week 45 (4.11. - 10.11.2019)*

### 1. Data wrangling

* **4.11.2019**: Started to work through the DataCamp exercises offered by the IODS course and was able to finish  
  + R Short and Sweet   
  + R Helsinki Open Data Science courses      
    

* **5.11.2019**: Start to work on R script for data wrangling and regression analysis  
  + Wrote the script for data wrangling and was able to finish that part    
      (all tests on the script worked)

***   
### 2. Analysis

The work on the analysis script and documentation started on 6.11.2019  

**1. Reading the data**  
Read the dataset table from my data folder and checked the dataframe structure and dimensions 
When I read the data table I set the "stringsAsFactor" agument (in the read.table function) to FALSE. So the observations in the gender column stay "F" and "M".  
The dataframe includes 166 observations (the rows) in 7 variables (the columns).  

**2. Graphical overview and data summary**  
    The data we analyise consists of a survey from students relating their learning approaches.
The data includes the students' gender, age, exam points and the global attitude towards statistics (consisting of a sum of 10 questions related to students attitude towards statistics, each measured on the Likert scale (1-5). The attitude value was divided by 10 in the data wrangling part to show the value in the 1-5 scale.

### 3. Regression models  
#### 3.1. Simple regression model of **point ~ attitude**
    
  Significant outcome was shown in the simple regression analysis of point ~ attitude  
  Here is the code:  

  att_lm <- lm(points ~ attitude, data = lrn14_analysis)  
  summary(att_lm)  

***    
#### 3.1.1. Summary table

    Call:
    lm(formula = points ~ attitude, data = lrn14_analysis)
